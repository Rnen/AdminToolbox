This is a plugin for SCL:Secret Lab servers. 
It offers multiple admin tools like 
* Friendly fire logs in server console & logs to file

* Heal & SetHP
* Warp Points
* Teleport to cordinates
* Prevent the round from ending
* Per-player stats
* Breaking doors interacted with
* Player Joined messages in server window

and more commands, and other features that do not exist in the base game (yet).
There is also more to come!

## ServerMod - (This is required for any plugin)

### Note that all commands below requires you to have `enable_ra_server_commands:` set to true in your `config_gameplay.txt`, and your steamID64/SERVER-ROLE added to the whitelist for them to work. This is part of [Smod](https://github.com/Grover-c13/Smod2), not the plugin.
